Once upon a time, there was a hidden village high up in the mountains, surrounded by forests so dense that hardly anyone knew it existed. The villagers lived in harmony with nature, cultivating the land with respect and harvesting only what they needed.

In this village lived a young woman named Lira, known for her bravery and curiosity. Since childhood, she had heard stories of a legendary tree in the heart of the forest, which, according to legend, granted a wish to anyone who found its roots hidden beneath the night’s mist. No one had ever found this tree, and many said it was just a tale for children.

One day, after a great storm, Lira noticed something strange happening in the forest: birds were singing songs she had never heard, and a mysterious glow shone among the trees. Determined, Lira ventured into the forest, guided by the birds’ song and the gentle light.

After hours of walking, as night was falling, Lira finally found the legendary tree. Its roots glowed in a magical blue, like a starry sky. Trembling with emotion, she closed her eyes and made a sincere wish: that her village would always have abundance and peace.

When she opened her eyes, the glow had disappeared, and the tree now looked just like any other. But upon returning to the village, Lira found that the land was more fertile and the harvests more abundant than ever. The village thrived, and everyone believed that Lira’s courage had brought them eternal fortune.

And from time to time, Lira returned to the forest, not to make more wishes but to silently thank the tree for the gift she had received.
